# Face_detection

This repository contains code for a simple face detection software in Python, using OpenCV and Haar Cascade Classifier.

<b><h2>Installation</b></h2>

- Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/face-detection.git.
- Install OpenCV by running pip install opencv-python in your terminal.
- Download the 'haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml' file and save it in the same directory as the code.

<b><h2>Usage</b></h2>

- Add an image named '   .jpg' in the same directory as the code.
- Run the code using any Python IDE or in your terminal using python face_detection.py.
- The software will load the image and detect any faces present in the image using the Haar Cascade Classifier.
- The detected face(s) will be highlighted with a green rectangle in the image.
- The final output image with the detected face(s) will be displayed.
